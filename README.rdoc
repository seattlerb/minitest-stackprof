== DESCRIPTION:

A minitest plugin that runs your tests and outputs a stackprof
profile. This lets you quickly and easily determine the bottlenecks in
your code under test!

* Make it right. (test first)
* Make it work.  (get to green)
* Make it fast.  (optimize)

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Provides a `--stackprof <path>` argument so you can make multiple
  profiles to compare over time.
* Provides a `--stackprof-type (wall|cpu|object)` argument so you can
  profile in different ways.

== SYNOPSIS:

  % rake TESTOPTS="--stackprof=profile.dump"
  Run options: -g --seed 59120
